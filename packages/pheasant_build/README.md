This package contains the build processes used in compiling pheasant files to valid dart code, including core pheasant framework functions like `createApp` used in "creating" the compiled application. It is not intended for direct use by the end user.

It also contains app configuration capabilities used by the framework's cli `pheasant`.

## Getting started

Get this package by running `dart pub`
```bash
dart pub add dev:pheasant_build
```

Then you can make use of it directly in your project.

This package isn't intended for direct use, but encapsulates the build processes used in building the code for a Pheasant Application Project.
